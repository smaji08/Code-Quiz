# Code-Quiz
https://smaji08.github.io/Code-Quiz/

This application was developed using Bootstrap 4.3.1, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and DOM API.

### Overview
This is an application to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals and JQuery that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress.

### Features

* Play proceeds as follows:


    - The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

    - The user can choose from 2 different quizes - JavaScript and JQuery.


    - Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions related to the selected topic. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.


    - Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (here, 10 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).


    - When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.

    - The Clear High Score clears it from the local storage as well.

#### Bonus
    * The Audio files for Correct and Wrong answers added.
    * Multiple Quizes added.
    * Minimum customization done.
    * Application added to https://smaji08.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/portfolio.html
